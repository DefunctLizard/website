		<h2>File Sharing Rules</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>You can upload almost any file you want to the server. Files can be downloaded by everyone! To upload a file, please contact me and tell that you want to upload files. I will make a folder on the website (yourName-files/), and then symlink it to your home folder, so that you can upload files to the server and move them into the file-sharing directory. The server will host the files in this directory to for the whole world to see!</p>
