		<h2>File Sharing Rules</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>You can upload almost any file you want to the server to be downloaded by anyone! To upload a file please contact me and let me know that you want to upload some files. Then I will make a folder on the website (name-files/), and then symlink it to your home folder. That way you can upload files to the server and move it into the file-sharing directory and the server will host it to for the whole world to see!</p>
