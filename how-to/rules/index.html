            <h2>Rules for the Server</h2>
	    <hr>
	    <p>The rules are really simple for the server:</p>

	     <ol>
		<li>Don't abuse the <code>wall</code> command</li>
		<li>Try not to store over 5GB of files. Obviously there are exceptions, but try not to go to far ðŸ˜‰</li>
	    	<li>Don't try to break the server. I spent a lot of time getting this up, and because of the way the users are setup you shouldn't be able to edit anything outside of your home directory, but things happen. If you find any bugs please report them to me.
	     </ol>
