<h1 id="I%20made%20it!">I made it!</h1>

<p>This is the first website I have created and so far it is turning out great.</p>

<p>I basically learned how to setup apache and write HTML/CSS in just one day and get a functional website up-and running which I am very proud of.</p>

<p>In these blog entries there aren&#8217;t many things I plan on putting here, just a few projects I&#8217;m working on and the tips and tricks that I have learned from this.</p>

<p>In my opinion (I just learned it), HTML is not the quickest way to write things down, that is why I have decided to write all of my blog entries in <code>markdown</code>, and then convert them into HTML after.</p>
