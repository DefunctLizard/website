<h1 id="I%20made%20it!">I made it!</h1>

<p>This is the first website I have created and so far it is turning out great.</p>

<p>I basically learned how to setup Apache and write HTML/CSS in just one day and get a functional website up and running, which I am very proud of.</p>

<p>There aren&#8217;t many things I plan on putting in these blog entries, just a few projects I&#8217;m working on, and also tips and tricks that I have learned from them.</p>

<p>In my opinion, HTML is not the quickest way to write things down (I just learned it), which is why I have decided to write all of my blog entries in <code>markdown</code>, and then convert them into HTML after.</p>
