# I made it!

This is the first website I have created and so far it is turning out great.

I basically learned how to setup apache and write HTML/CSS in just one day and get a functional website up-and running which I am very proud of.

In these blog entries there aren't many things I plan on putting here, just a few projects I'm working on and the tips and tricks that I have learned from this.

In my opinion (I just learned it), HTML is not the quickest way to write things down, that is why I have decided to write all of my blog entries in `markdown`, and then convert them into HTML after.
