# I made it!

This is the first website I have created and so far it is turning out great.

I basically learned how to setup Apache and write HTML/CSS in just one day and get a functional website up and running, which I am very proud of.

There aren't many things I plan on putting in these blog entries, just a few projects I'm working on, and also tips and tricks that I have learned from them.

In my opinion, HTML is not the quickest way to write things down (I just learned it), which is why I have decided to write all of my blog entries in `markdown`, and then convert them into HTML after.
